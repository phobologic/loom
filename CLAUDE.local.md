# loom — Local Conventions

## Design Principles (push back if violated)

loom has named design principles in `planning/requirements.md` → Key Design Principles.
**Read that section before planning any feature.** When a ticket, spec, or user request
proposes something that conflicts with these principles — even subtly — raise it before
implementing. Don't just build what's asked.

Red flags to catch:

- A vote or majority decision that can **override already-canon player contributions** →
  violates "Author authority on canon". Challenge resolution is discussion + author decides,
  not a vote that forces a change.

- A **hard block** on player action where a nudge or suggestion would do →
  violates "Nudges over mandates". Prefer "you've posted 3 beats, maybe let others in?"
  over "you cannot post a fourth beat."

- **AI output becoming canon without player confirmation** → violates "AI assists, players
  decide". AI generates options; players choose.

- **Organizer getting narrative shortcuts** (approve stuck proposals, skip a challenge on
  their own game, override a vote) → violates "Organizer has no narrative privilege."

- **Adversarial framing** in collaborative features — voting to "defeat" someone else's
  content, challenge mechanisms that feel like accusations rather than conversations.

When you catch one: name the principle, explain the conflict, and propose an alternative
before proceeding.
