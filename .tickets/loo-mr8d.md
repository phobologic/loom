# Step 46: Narrative Voice Configuration

During Session 0, the AI offers sample narrative voice options based on the chosen genre/tone (e.g., terse noir, lyrical fantasy, dry humor). The group selects or customizes a default voice. Stored as part of game configuration and used for all prose expansion and narrative compilation. This extends the Session 0 flow built in Phase 1.
