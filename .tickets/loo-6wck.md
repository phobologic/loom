# Step 8: Session 0 Completion + World Document

'Ready to play' proposal, early exit flow, world document generation (stubbed AI), group reviews and approves, game transitions from 'setup' to 'active.' Includes a minimal voting mechanism to support the approval (yes/no votes, threshold check). Full voting comes in Step 18.

## Acceptance Criteria

### REQ-S0-003: World Document
*Requirement:* When Session 0 prompts have been completed, Loom shall produce a world document that captures the agreed-upon setting, tone, themes, and boundaries.
*Acceptance Criteria:*
- The world document is generated by the AI based on all Session 0 inputs.
- All players can review and suggest edits to the world document.
- The group approves the world document via the standard voting mechanism.
- The world document is available for reference throughout play.
- The world document is used as context for all AI features (oracle, prose expansion, etc.).

NOTE: AI generation is stubbed in this step.

### REQ-S0-005: Early Exit from Session 0
*Requirement:* When all players agree they have enough to start playing, Loom shall allow the group to exit Session 0 early and begin play.
*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Any player can propose "ready to play."
- If all players agree (standard voting), Loom finalizes whatever has been established so far into the world document and transitions the game to "active" state.
- Loom generates a world document from whatever has been completed, even if some prompts were skipped.
- Minimum requirement to exit: a game name and at least one sentence of setting/pitch exist.

### REQ-GAME-005: Game States
*Requirement:* Loom shall track game state through a defined lifecycle.
*Acceptance Criteria:*
- Game states: setup (Session 0 in progress), active (play in progress), paused, archived.
- Only the organizer can pause or archive a game.
- A paused game can be resumed by the organizer.
- An archived game is read-only but still viewable.

---

### REQ-VOTE-001: Voting Mechanics
*Requirement:* When a major beat, scene transition, act transition, or other significant proposal is submitted, Loom shall manage a voting process.
*Acceptance Criteria:*
- The proposer's submission counts as an implicit "yes" vote.
- The threshold for approval is more than half of all players in the game (e.g., in a 3-player game, 2 votes needed; in a 4-player game, 3 votes needed; in a 5-player game, 3 votes needed).
- In a 2-player game, the other player must explicitly approve major proposals.
- Players can vote yes, no, or suggest a modification.
- Votes and suggestions are visible to all players.
