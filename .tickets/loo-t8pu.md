# Step 38: Fortune Roll Oracle Follow-up

On Exceptional Yes or Exceptional No Fortune Roll, prompt: 'That's an exceptional result - want the oracle to suggest what that means?' If accepted, invokes full interpretive oracle with Fortune Roll question as context, exceptional result as constraint, and word seed pair for inspiration. Player can decline. Regular Yes/No don't trigger. Requirements: REQ-ORACLE-008.
