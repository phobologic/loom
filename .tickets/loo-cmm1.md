# Step 32: Pacing - Consecutive Beat Limit + Contribution Visibility

After configurable consecutive narrative beats from same player (default 3), show gentle nudge. OOC events don't count. Also: lightweight display of each player's recent contribution frequency on scene page for social self-regulation. Requirements: REQ-PACE-001, REQ-PACE-002.
