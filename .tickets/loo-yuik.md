# AI prompt audit and example run review

Once the app is mostly complete, do a thorough audit of all AI prompts in the codebase. For each prompt: review the wording, run it against real or generated content, and evaluate the quality of the output. Goal is to surface prompts that are underperforming or inconsistent before a wider rollout.
