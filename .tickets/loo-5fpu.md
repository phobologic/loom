# AI-assisted NPC detection and quick-create from beat text

When a player introduces a new NPC in a beat (either detected from IC narrative text, or via an explicit 'Create NPC from this' button on a beat), the system should offer to pre-fill an NPC creation form using AI. The AI suggests name/description/notes based on the beat context; the player reviews and confirms before saving. This follows the 'AI assists, players decide' principle — AI never auto-creates canon entries.
