# Step 27: AI Usage Tracking

Log every AI call with: feature that triggered it, input/output token counts, context components included, model used, and timestamp. Data queryable for analysis, not exposed to players in v1. Implemented early so all subsequent Phase 2 AI features are built with logging from the start. Requirements: REQ-AI-002.
