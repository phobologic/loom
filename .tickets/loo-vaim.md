# Step 36: AI Pre-submission Consistency Check

Before beat submission, AI checks against world document, recent beats, character/NPC/world facts, current roll results, and lines/veils. Inconsistencies flagged to author privately before submission. Advisory only - does not block submission. Player can revise or submit anyway. Requirements: REQ-BEAT-005.
