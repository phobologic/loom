# Phase 1: Core Loop

The minimum viable play experience for Loom. Covers project scaffolding, data models, dev auth, Session 0, character creation, game dashboard, act and scene management, beat submission with multi-event support, dice rolling, the full beat lifecycle and voting system, the interpretive oracle with word seeds, Fortune Roll, in-app notifications, and AI integration (real calls).

Steps are linearly dependent: each step is blocked by the previous one. Run 'tk ready' to see what's currently unblocked.
