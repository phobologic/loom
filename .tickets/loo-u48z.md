# Step 48: Act Narrative Compilation

When an act is completed (and auto-narrative is enabled), the AI generates a prose narrative for the act, incorporating scene narratives and the act's overall arc. Uses the act's guiding question and resolution as framing. Stored with the act and viewable by all players. Read-only in v1.
